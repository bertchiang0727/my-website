    <h2>Task-scheduling-systems</h2>
    <p>
      The Task-Scheduling System was implemented on the Eurobot 2024 competition robot. Its objective is to 
      achieve the maximum possible score within 100 seconds while ensuring the robot returns to its designated 
      position before the time limit. The system also incorporates adversarial awareness, enabling it to evaluate 
      whether the opponent’s robot interferes with task execution. Based on this, it generates the optimal path 
      planning strategy to maximize efficiency and secure victory.

    <h3>The Decision Tree</h3>
    <p>
      Implement a Python-based decision tree that fuses multi-sensor feedback and performs opponent state estimation 
      (position and velocity) to dynamically select optimal task targets and paths. A time stop-loss mechanism is incorporated 
      to ensure the robot does the right action at the right time, preventing overtime penalties and minimizing half-completed, 
      non-scoring tasks—ultimately improving decision robustness and scoring efficiency.

    <h3>User Interface</h3>
    <p>
      We integrated Groot to visualize our decision tree with a UI interface. This allows us to modify task goals or add new 
      constraints more efficiently, while also making it easier to identify and debug issues within the system, thereby improving 
      both maintainability and development speed.
